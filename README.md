Tool to publish local ip to no-ip dyndns service.

## Why?
So I can access my computer on my home network (and also tell other people to access it) via a simple to remember address.

## How to use it?
Copy (or rename) the file default-config.js to config.js and edit the appropriate values. Then run ```node index```. You can also set it up as a cron job (like I do).
